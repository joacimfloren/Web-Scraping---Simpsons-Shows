# Web-Scraping---Simpsons-Shows
A small Python application crawling a TV-show site looking for the upcoming Simpsons shows.

An previous teacher of mine introduced me to Web Scraping and showed me some examples of how great it could be to use Python for that purpose.
In order to learn some more Python I created a really small application which goes through a web site containing information about upcoming TV episodes.
The application is a big Homer fan, therefore it only scrapes the upcoming Simpsons episodes.
